# 🚀 RepoDownloader: The Only GitHub Repo Downloader You'll Ever Need (Probably)

Welcome to **RepoDownloader** – the app that lets you search, sort, and download GitHub repos faster than you can say "npm install". Built for devs who want their code _now_, with style, accessibility, and a sprinkle of chaos.

## Features

- 🔍 **Search** for any public GitHub repo (no, we can't hack private ones... yet)
- ⭐ **Sort** by stars or name, ascending/descending, because you deserve options
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** with dark/light mode, animated repo cards, and a branch dropdown that actually works
- 🌈 **Download** any branch as a ZIP, with a progress bar so you can watch your impatience in real time
- 🏷️ **Topics, badges, and more** – because aesthetics matter
- 🦾 **Accessible** (keyboard, screen reader, and probably even with your nose)
- 🦄 **Modern tech**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion, and a dash of magic

## How To Use

1. Clone this repo (or just stare at it, your call)
2. `npm install` (or `pnpm install` if you're feeling spicy)
3. `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. Search for a repo, pick a branch, and download like a boss

## Why Does This Exist?

Because downloading GitHub repos should be fun, fast, and look good doing it. Also, because Ritesh Pandit wanted to flex his UI skills and make your life easier.

## Who Made This?

Made with ❤️ by [Ritesh Pandit](https://riteshdpandit.vercel.app) – the one, the only, the legend. Go check out his portfolio and hire him before Google does.
